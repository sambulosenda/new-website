# What's New in React Native 0.76

React Native 0.76 has arrived with significant improvements and new features that make developing mobile apps even better. Let's explore what this update brings to your projects!

## New Architecture by Default

The biggest news in this release is that the New Architecture is now enabled by default. This isn't just a minor update - it's a complete rewrite of React Native's foundation. This change brings improved performance and provides a solid foundation for building high-quality native applications.

## Faster Development with Metro

Performance improvements continue with Metro, React Native's JavaScript bundler. The module resolution system has received a major upgrade:

- Import module finding is now 15 times faster
- Warm builds are up to 4 times faster

This means less time waiting for builds and more time actually developing your app!

## Lighter Android Apps

Android developers will be happy to know that app sizes are getting smaller. By consolidating native code into a single library called 'libreactnative.so', this update brings:

- 3.8 MB reduction in Android app size
- 15 milliseconds faster startup time

Every megabyte counts when users are downloading your app, and every millisecond matters for user experience!

## Enhanced Styling Capabilities

### Box Shadow

The new boxShadow feature gives you more control over element shadows, allowing you to adjust:

- Position
- Color
- Size
- Blur

### Filter Effects

Add visual effects to your elements with the new filter property:

- Brightness
- Saturation
- Blur effects

Note: iOS currently has limited filter support, only working with brightness and opacity.

## Improved Developer Tools

The debugging experience gets a major upgrade with new React Native DevTools:

- Chrome DevTools-based debugger
- Support for breakpoints
- Stack inspection capabilities
- Step-by-step debugging
- Improved component highlighting
- No configuration needed

Getting started is as simple as opening the Dev Menu in your app or using the 'j' option in the CLI.

## Impact on Development

These updates bring significant improvements to your development workflow:

### Performance

- Faster build times
- Reduced app size
- Quicker startup times

### Developer Experience

- Better debugging tools
- Enhanced styling options
- Improved architecture

### User Experience

- Smaller app downloads

## What This Means for You
