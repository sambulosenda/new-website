# Getting Started with React Native Development

React Native is a popular framework for building native mobile applications using React. In this guide, we'll cover the basics of getting started with React Native development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)

## Setting Up Your First Project

```bash
npx react-native init MyFirstApp
cd MyFirstApp
```

## Basic Components

React Native provides several core components:

```jsx
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Hello, React Native!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```
